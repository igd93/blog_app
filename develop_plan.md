# MVP Overview for Blog App

## Project Structure
- **Monorepo Setup:**  
  - Root repository containing two main subfolders:
    - `/backend` – Spring Boot application.
    - `/frontend` – React application.

## 1. Define Requirements & MVP Features
- **Core Features:**
  - **User Authentication:**  
    - Registration and login functionality.
  - **Blog Management:**  
    - Create, edit, view, and delete blogs.

  - **Subscription Model:**  
    - Allow users to subscribe/unsubscribe to blogs.
  - **Public Blog Viewing:**  
    - Enable visitors to read blogs and posts.
- **Non-functional Requirements:**
  - Responsive design (desktop and mobile).
  - Secure API endpoints.
  - Basic error handling and logging.
  - Scalability for future enhancements.

## 2. Backend (Spring Boot)
- **Project Setup:**
  - Initialize a Spring Boot project in the `/backend` folder.
  - Include necessary dependencies (Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, Spring Security).
- **Database Integration:**
  - Configure PostgreSQL as the datastore.
  - Use JPA/Hibernate for ORM and database interactions.
- **Data Models & API Endpoints:**
  - **Entities:**  
    - User, Blog, Post, Subscription.
  - **API Endpoints:**  
    - User authentication and profile management.
    - CRUD for blogs and posts.
    - Subscription handling.
- **Security:**
  - Implement JWT or session-based authentication.
- **Testing:**
  - Develop unit and integration tests for controllers and services.

## 3. Frontend (React)
- **Project Setup:**
  - Initialize a React project in the `/frontend` folder (using Create React App or similar).
- **Routing & State Management:**
  - Use React Router for page navigation.
  - Utilize Context API or Redux for state management.
- **UI Components & Pages:**
  - Home page: List available blogs.
  - Blog detail page: Display blog posts and subscription options.
  - Post detail page: Detailed view of individual posts.
  - User pages: Login, registration, and profile management.
- **API Integration:**
  - Connect to Spring Boot REST endpoints.
  - Handle asynchronous calls with error handling and loading states.
- **Responsive Design:**
  - Ensure a mobile-first and responsive UI.

## 4. Database (PostgreSQL)
- **Schema Design:**
  - Create tables for users, blogs, posts, and subscriptions.
- **Configuration:**
  - Set up environment variables for database connection.
  - Ensure proper integration with Spring Boot via JPA.

## 5. Docker & Containerization
- **Dockerfiles:**
  - Create separate Dockerfiles for the backend and frontend.
- **Docker Compose:**
  - Write a `docker-compose.yml` to orchestrate:
    - Spring Boot container.
    - React container.
    - PostgreSQL container.
- **Environment & Networking:**
  - Define necessary environment variables.
  - Configure container networking to ensure communication between services.

## 6. CI/CD & Deployment
- **Pipeline Setup:**
  - Integrate CI/CD for automated building, testing, and deployment.
  - Automate Docker image builds and container deployments.
- **Deployment Strategy:**
  - Select a hosting platform (cloud provider or on-premise).
  - Implement monitoring, logging, and error tracking for production readiness.

## 7. Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)
- **Advanced Features:**
  - Role-based access control and enhanced security measures.
  - Analytics, performance monitoring, and SEO optimization.
  - Monetization options (e.g., paid subscriptions).
- **Scalability:**
  - Plan for horizontal scaling of both frontend and backend.
  - Introduce caching layers for high traffic.
